# TransportNow
This is an Android application that provides a convenient means for notifying members of a volunteer animal rescue group of the need for transportation of an animal (e.g., a dog) from one location to another. For example, pulling a dog from an animal shelter and transporting the animal to a veterinary hospital or foster home.

The application includes a straightforward interface that helps link potential drivers with the transport coordinator. A coordinator may build and create a transport request with the app, and volunteers can immediately see a listing of transport requests and needs and may then reply back via the app.
